# go-tls-server-client
 Basic Go TLS client-server implementation.

## Running the Server and Client

Assuming you have Go installed:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory:

```cd path/to/go-tls-echo```


2. To run the server:

```go run cmd/server/main.go```

3. Open another terminal, navigate to the same project directory, and run the client:

```go run cmd/client/main.go```

Make sure to run the server before the client.
